Auto-Brighteness-Control:
--------------------------
a simple tool to help you set the ideal brightness levels
for your sight and hopefully longer batery.

Most modern devices have a light sensor. However there is still a large
amount of laptops that don't. When commuting one has to constantly adjust
levels of brightness for the environment or just live with the fact batery
will end quickly. Therefor with this, I intend to automate that process
and make use of the builtin camera to see how much light is in the environment
